Crime is a deliberate unlawful act that is expected to affect various operations and sectors, 
including the real estate market. The assumption is that crime hurts residential property prices, 
but the situation is more complicated, and the degree of impact varies .
The ‘Housing Committee’ and ‘Police and Crime Committee’ of the London assembly are 
interested in investigating how the spatial effects in the housing market are related to crime 
incidence and whether the effects differ by sort of offense. . 
Given the influence of crime on the housing market, policies could be updated to help reduce 
crime, to improve residential quality of life, and the betterment of local property markets.
The beneficiary of this project would be the London residents 
ultimately.
